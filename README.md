# web-note

## What it does

This add-on adds a sidebar that lets allows you take notes on the current web page. The notes are saved to local storage, and the notes for each page are shown again when you open that page again.

The example also uses the `commands` manifest key to add a keyboard shortcut that opens the sidebar.

## What it shows

How to create a sidebar for an add-on. How to associate the sidebar with the currently active tab in that sidebar's window. How to store and restore sidebar content.

## Future Enhancement

There should be way to add see all my web-note in single html page with link to their web pages and possibility to open them in new tab.
